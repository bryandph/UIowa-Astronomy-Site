# UIowa-Astronomy-SiteAn alternative design for the UIowa Astronomy site built as a Flask app. The development of this project was inspired by the want to design a replacement for the University of Iowa's Astronomy and Physics departmental sites and the content was taken and based on one of the undergraduate lab refrence sites, [UIowa Astronomy | Imaging the Universe](http://astro.physics.uiowa.edu/ITU/). This project was **not** commissioned or endorsed by The University of Iowa or any affiliated entity. The Trademarks and content within are used under Fair Use terms for self education.## Project GoalThis project takes a website with content provided in Markdown and Latex and uses Bootstrap3 to create a static site. It's use case is comparable with frameworks like Jekyll, where minimizing code exposure to the end user is of max importance.## Current Build StateThis project is currently under development. At its current build state, the site is generated dynamically at the initialization of the app and part of the HTML is stored in memory. The site is still partially generated per request which makes it unsuitable for production given the overhead of each request.### Future Development* Generate as much static content as possible on initialization and store to disk.* Extend with WSGI to allow provisioning of Apache or Nginx webservers.* Add a caching mechanism to further speed up request response time.
