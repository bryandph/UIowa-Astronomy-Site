#Kepler's Third Law


Kepler discovered that the size of a planet's orbit (the semi-major axis of the ellipse) is simply related to sidereal period of the orbit.  If the size of the orbit ($a$) is expressed in astronomical units (`1 AU` equals the average distance between the Earth and the Sun) and the period ($P$) is measured in years, then Kepler's Third Law says:
 
$$P^2 \propto a^3$$

After applying Newton's Laws of Motion and Newton's Law of Gravity we find that Kepler's Third Law takes a more general form:

$$P^2= \frac{ 4 \pi^2 }{ G(M_1 + M_2) }a^3$$

where $M_1$ and $M2_2$ are the masses of the two orbiting objects in solar masses. Note that if the mass of one body, such as $M_1$, is much larger than the other, then $M_1 + M_2$ is nearly equal to $M_1$. In our solar system $M_1 = 1$ solar mass, and this equation becomes identical to the first.

##Example

Phobos orbits Mars with an average distance of about `9380 km` from the center of the planet and a rotational period of about `7 hr 39 min`.  Use this information to estimate the mass of Mars.


##Solution

$a = 9380\,km = 9.38 \times 106\,m$

$P = 7\,hr\;39\,min = 7.65\,hr = 27540\,sec$

$(27540\,sec) ^ 2 = \frac{4 \pi ^ 2}{6.673 \times 10^{-11}\,m^{3}kg^{-1}s^{-2}}(9.38 \times 10^6\,m)^3$

$\frac{(9.38 \times 10^6\,m)^3)}{(27540\,s)^2} \cdot \frac{4 \pi ^ 2}{6.673 \times 10^{-11}\,m^{3}kg^{-1}s^{-2}} = (M_1+M_2)$
$(M_1+M_2) = 6.44 \times 10^{23}\,kg$


Since the mass of Mars is so much greater than the mass of Phobos, $M_1 + M_2$ is very nearly equal to the mass of Mars, so this is a good estimate.
